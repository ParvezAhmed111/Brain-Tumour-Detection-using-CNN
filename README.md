# Brain-Tumour-Detection-using-CNN

Brain Tumor is the deadliest of all types of malignancy. The brain is a part of the body's nervous system (CNS). Identifying brain tumors was a really
challenging task in the early stages of life, but now it has become easy to spot with various advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

In this project, I proposed a model to predict cancer. 
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to build the model. 
A data set containing 2D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images without contrast is used to train the model.
In my work, CNN achieved an accuracy of 91.06% after training with many epochs.
